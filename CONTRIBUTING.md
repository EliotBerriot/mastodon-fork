Please use the search function to make sure that you are not submitting duplicates, and that a similar report or request has not already been resolved or rejected.

## Pull requests

## Translations

We will be using Weblate for translations in the near future, but we're waiting for a free account for Open Source Projects via Weblate themselves, in the meanwhile you can submit PRs with translations, or wait. We will update this document as soon as Weblate is available for translations, and will make public announcements elsewhere.

## Documentation

Documentation work will be added soon, and in the meanwhile you can join us in our [Chat] for documentation.

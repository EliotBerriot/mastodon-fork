## Adding an Issue for Bug Report or Feature Request

Bug reports and feature suggestions can be submitted to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/florence-social/mastodon-fork/issues). Do not worry about submitting duplicates, but please make a cursory search to see if any similar reports or request have already been resolved or rejected in the past using the search function. If you find a bug or feature request which matches yours you can join the conversation by adding your commentary to that issue.

Try to describe your issue, the use-case, and additional considerations when submitting a feature request.

## Translations

We will be using Weblate for translations in the near future, but we're waiting for a free account for Open Source Projects via Weblate themselves, in the meanwhile you can submit PRs with translations, or wait. We will update this document as soon as Weblate is available for translations, and will make public announcements elsewhere.

## Documentation

Documentation work will be added soon, and in the meanwhile you can join us in our [Chat] for documentation.
